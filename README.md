# What is Book Recommender System
A recommender system can be defined as a system that produces individual recommendations as output, based on previous decisions that the system considers to be inputs. Book recommendation systems play an important role in book search engines, digital libraries, or book shopping sites.
Virtually everyone has had an online experience where a website makes personalized recommendations in hopes of future sales or ongoing traffic. Amazon tells you “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought”, Udemy tells you “Students Who Viewed This Course Also Viewed”. And Netflix awarded a $1 million prize to a developer team in 2009, for an algorithm that increased the accuracy of the company’s recommendation system by 10 percent.
